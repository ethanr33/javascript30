This is a responsive online recipe notebook made that I made using HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript, and React. You can find the link to the project here:
http://ethanroos.website/recipeapp/.

In the app, you can search for, add, view, and remove recipies all on one single page. The recipies are retrieved from TheMealDB API.
